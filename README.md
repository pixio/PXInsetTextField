## Usage

Use it just like a UITextField.  But then also set the insets property.  Because if you aren't using it, why did you install this pod?

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

PXInsetTextField is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "PXInsetTextField"
```
